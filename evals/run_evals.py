"""Do the skills actually do what they claim?

    python3 evals/run_evals.py --case reply-parent
    python3 evals/run_evals.py --list

The tests in `tests/` check the plumbing and the documents. Nothing checks the
thing the bundle actually is: 7,000 lines of instructions an agent follows. This
does, by running the agent against a fixture and grading what comes back.

Each case pastes its input into the prompt rather than relying on a key, which
is both cheaper and the path most users are on: with no APIFY_TOKEN the reading
skills ask you to paste, so this exercises the manual flow end to end.

Graders are deterministic and narrow on purpose. They check claims that have a
right answer — the parentComment for a nested reply, whether a scrubbed draft
kept the user's real numbers — not whether the prose is any good. A grader that
needs taste is a grader that will drift.

Costs one model call per case.
