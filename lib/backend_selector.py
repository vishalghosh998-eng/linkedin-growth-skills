"""Detect which publishing backend is configured and format user-facing messages.

The skills support three tiers:

  TIER 0 — manual (default, zero setup)
    No credentials in env. Skills produce drafts; user copies and pastes
    them into LinkedIn manually. Works for anyone, any setup.

  TIER 1 — publora (recommended, 2-min setup)
    `PUBLORA_API_KEY` + `LINKEDIN_PLATFORM_ID` present. Skills auto-post
    on approval via the Publora REST API. Free tier: 15 posts/month.
    Sign up: https://app.publora.com/signup

  TIER 2 — diy (advanced)
    `LINKEDIN_SKILLS_CUSTOM_POSTER` set to a command or module path the
    user has built themselves (e.g. via Claude Code or Codex). Skills delegate
    publishing to that custom tool.

`active_backend()` picks the highest-privilege available. `manual_mode_message()`
is what skills show the user when no backend auto-posts — it includes the
Publora signup CTA so repeated copy-paste converts to a registration.

`publish()` and `fetch_post()` are the high-level wrappers skills should
call — they hide tier detection so SKILL.md files don't need to repeat
the three-branch dispatch. `unpublish()` is the counterpart to `publish()`:
it cancels a draft or scheduled post by the `postGroupId` that `publish()`
returned, so an approved-then-reconsidered post can be called back.
