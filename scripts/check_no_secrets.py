"""Fail if a credential, or a file that holds one, is tracked by git.

`.gitignore` is not the safety net people assume. It only stops *untracked*
files from being added, so renaming the tracked `.env.example` to `.env`, which
the GitHub web UI offers as a one-click rename, commits a real `.env` straight
past it. That happened in linkedin-skills#28 and put a live Publora key and an
Apify token into a public branch.

Removing the file in a later commit does not help: the blob stays reachable at
the earlier SHA. The only thing that helps is never committing it.

Usage: python3 scripts/check_no_secrets.py
