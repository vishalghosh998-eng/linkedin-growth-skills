"""The instructions are the product; this checks the parts of them a machine can.

7,000-odd lines of markdown do the actual work here, and almost none of it can
be unit tested — whether a hook formula is any good is not a matter of fact. But
plenty of it rots in ways that are: a skill renamed and a sibling still pointing
at the old name, a Files list naming something deleted, a formula cited by a
number nobody defined, a platform limit LinkedIn has since changed.

None of that shows up in a diff review, and all of it reaches the agent as
instructions it will follow.

Offline. No credentials, no network: platform limits come from a recorded
fixture, so a drift here means our docs moved, not that LinkedIn did.
